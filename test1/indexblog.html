                One of my lockdown projects was to make my sit/stand Controller
                smart. I used a raspberry Pi to create a custom controller that could control the motor
                on my desjkk and allow me to rise and lower it over the network
                as well as via a touch-interface.

            <h4>Sending Ember actions down to components</h4>
            <p>"Data down, actions up" is an often repeated mantra of the Ember
                community, and for good reasons. Some-times though, you need to call
                actions on components in a "downward" direction. In this post I'll give
                you an approach for breaking this DDAU rule.

            <h4>"Route variable" pattern with Ember</h4>
            <p>There arre a couple of different libraries for Ember that 
                add the ability to set the page title for each page in Your
                application by simply creating a 'title' property on each route.
                This is a great general purpose patterrn for declarative information
                that needs to be set across routes. For example you mighht want
                to add breadcrumbs, or just a different heading on each page. This Post
                 will outline how to go about creating this pattern yourself.
