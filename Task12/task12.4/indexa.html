                    <h2>IT IS PITY COOL WIND</h2>
                    <p>The east wind, is responsible for numerous cases of suicide...Black melancholy spreads over 
                        the whole nation.Even the animals suffer from it and have a dejected air.Men who are strong 
                        enough to preserve their health in thus accused wind atleast lost their good  humour. Everyone
                         wears a grim expression and is inclined to make desperate decisions. It was literally in an east 
                         wind that Charles I was beheaded and James deposed.</p>

                    <h2>Westerlies</h2>
                    <p>WEsterlies are prevaling winds that blow from the west at midaltitudes. They are fed by polar
                        easterlies and winds from the high-pressure horse laltitudes,which sandwhich them on either sid.
                        Westerlies are strongest in the winter, when pressure over the pole is low, and weakest in summer
                        when the polar high creates stronger polar easterlies.

                    <h2>Horse Latitudes..</h2>
                    <p>
                        The horse latitudes are a narrow zone of warm,dry climates between westerlies and the trade winds.
                        Horse latitudes are about 30 and 35 degrees north and south. Maany deserts,from the rainless Atacama
                        of South America to the arid Kalahari of Africa, are part of the horse latitudes.The prevailing winds 
                        at the horse latitudes vary, but are usually light. Even strong winds are often short in duration.

                    <h2>Trade Winds..</h2>
                    <p>Trade winds are the powerful prevailing winds that blow from the east across the topics. Trade winds are 
                        generally very predictable. They have been instrumental in the history of explorationm communication, 
                        and trade. Ships relied on trade winds to establish quick, reliable routes across the vast Atlantic and
                         later, Pacific Oceans. Even today, shipping depends on trade winds and the ocean currents they drive.</p>

                    <h2>Hurricane</h2>
                        <p>A hurricane is a giant, spiraling tropical strom that can pack wind speeds of over 257 kph(160 mph)
                            and unleash more than 9 trillion liters(2.4 trillion gallons) of rain. These same tropical storms 
                            are known as hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean, and typhoons
                            in the Western Pacific Ocean.These tropical storms havea spiral shape. The spiral(swirling counter-clockwise
                            in the Northern Hemispheree and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere)develops as a high pressure area that 
                            twists around a low-pressure area.

                    <h2>Typhoon</h2>
                    <p>Typhoons are tropical storms that develop over the northwest Pacific Ocean. Their formation is identical to 
                        hurricanes and cyclones. Typhoons form as equitorial winds and blow westward before tuning north and merging
                    with westetrlies around the mid-latitudes. Typhoons can impact a wide area of the eastern pacific. The islands of 
                    the Philippines, China, Vietnam, and Japan are the most effected.</p>
