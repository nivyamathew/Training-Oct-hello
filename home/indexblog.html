            <p>Yesterday, <a href=""> a post i had submitted to Hacker News</a>
            got pushed up to the front page. Outside of retiring and basking in my
        new-found internet fame, i wanted to show what a few hours on the 
        front-page looks like.</p>

            <h4>Home Made Standing Desk Raspberry Pi Controller</h4>
            <p>
                One of my lockdown projects was to make my sit/stand Controller
                smart. I used a raspberry Pi to create a custom controller that could control the motor
                on my desjkk and allow me to rise and lower it over the network
                as well as via a touch-interface.
